      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Austin Persek is a lifelong collector with a deep-rooted passion for the Pokémon Trading Card Game. Growing up by the beach, Austin spent countless hours trading and collecting Pokémon cards with friends. At the start of the Sword & Shield era, he rediscovered his love for the hobby and from that point on, his knowledge and expertise in the Pokémon TCG have grown exponentially.
        <br><br>
        Today, Austin is not only an avid collector but also an active competitive player. He regularly participates in local Pokémon tournaments, testing his skills, refining strategies, and staying up-to-date with the latest decks and meta shifts. His passion goes beyond the cards themselves — he enjoys building connections within the community and helping new players learn the game.
        <br><br>
        With a sharp eye for valuable collectibles and a deep understanding of the TCG landscape, Austin brings both enthusiasm and expertise to SurfCity Collectibles. Whether you're looking for a rare card, advice on building a deck, or just want to chat about Pokémon, Austin is always excited to share his knowledge and love for the game.

        Hey, I’m Dane Persek, the other half of SurfCity Collectibles! Like Austin, I’ve loved Pokémon since we were kids, spending hours trading cards, building decks, and collecting our favorites. But over the past few years, I’ve found another huge passion: Legos. I've become a true expert when it comes to Lego sets — whether it’s building, collecting, or tracking down rare releases, it’s something I genuinely love and know inside and out.
        <br><br>
        Lately, I’ve also started diving into the One Piece TCG world — an exciting and fast-growing market that I’m super pumped to be a part of. Whether it’s cards, bricks, or anything collectible, I’m always on the hunt for the coolest finds and the next big thing.
